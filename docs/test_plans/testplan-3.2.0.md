1. [x] Verify successful instance group and isolated instance group installations w/ tower-packaging split

### Instance Groups / External Ramparts (Michael & Jim)
[Feature](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11G1Khsy8PUxAM8b8b0e5WxkiDUttI0tE72VrxfkGMcw)

When verifying acceptance we should ensure the following statements are true

1. [x] Tower should install as a standalone Instance
1. [x] Tower should install in a Clustered fashion
1. [x] Instances should, optionally, be able to be grouped arbitrarily into different Instance Groups
1. [x] Capacity should be tracked at the group level and capacity impact should make sense relative to what instance a job is running on and what groups that instance is a member of.
1. [x] Provisioning should be supported via the setup playbook
1. [ ] De-provisioning should be supported via a management command
1. [ ] All jobs, inventory updates, and project updates should run successfully
1. [x] Jobs should be able to run on hosts which it is targeted. If assigned implicitly or directly to groups then it should only run on instances in those Instance Groups.
1. [x] Project updates should manifest their data on the tower host that will run the job immediately prior to the job running
1. [x] Tower should be able to reasonably survive the removal of all instances in the cluster
1. [x] Tower should behave in a predictable fashiong during network partitioning
1. [x] Users should not be able to assign instance groups to a job without the correct RBACS role

#### Testing Considerations

1. [x] Basic testing should be able to demonstrate parity with a standalone instance for all integration testing.
1. [x] Run existing integration tests verifying job (etc) behaviour, specifically targetting an isolated instance group.
1. [x] Basic setup playbook testing to verify routing differences, including:
    * [x] Basic FQDN
    * [x] Hostname
    * [ ] ~~Short-name name resolution~~ (really a duplicate of `/etc/hosts` routing)
    * [x] ip addresses
    * [x] /etc/hosts static routing information
1. [ ] We should test behavior of large and small clusters. I would envision small clusters as 2 - 3 instances and large clusters as 10 - 15 instances
1. [x] Failure testing should involve killing single instances and killing multiple instances while the cluster is performing work. Job failures during the time period should be predictable and not catastrophic.
1. [ ] Instance downtime testing should also include recoverability testing. Killing single services and ensuring the system can return itself to a working state
1. [x] Persistent failure should be tested by killing single services in such a way that the cluster instance cannot be recovered and ensuring that the instance is properly taken offline
1. [x] Network partitioning failures will be important also. In order to test this
    * [x] Disallow a single instance from communicating with the other instances but allow it to communicate with the database
    * [x] Break the link between instances such that it forms 2 or more groups where groupA and groupB can't communicate but all instances can communicate with the database.
1. [x] Crucially when network partitioning is resolved all instances should recover into a consistent state
1. [ ] Upgrade Testing, verify behavior before and after are the same for the end user.
1. [ ] Project Updates should be thoroughly tested for all scm types (git, svn, hg) and for manual projects.
1. [x] Setting up instance groups in two scenarios: a) instances are shared between groups b) instances are isolated to particular groups Organizations, Inventories, and Job Templates should be variously assigned to one or many groups and jobs should execute in those groups in preferential order as resources are available.

#### Performance Testing

Performance testing should be twofold:

1. [ ] Large volume of simultaneous jobs.
1. [ ] Jobs that generate a large amount of output.

These should also be benchmarked against the same playbooks using:
1. [ ] 3.1.5 Tower release, and 
1. [ ] a stable Ansible version. 

For a large volume playbook I might recommend a customer provided one that we've seen recently:

https://gist.github.com/michelleperz/fe3a0eb4eda888221229730e34b28b89

Against 100+ hosts.

### Named URL access in API (slug) (Michael)
[Feature](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dQObu1jV9zOz8FLlktipaySe9lbdT8-Jo99RL0bksok/edit)

1. [x] The classical way of getting objects via primary keys should behave the same.
1. [x] Tower configuration part of named URL should work as described. Particularly, `NAMED_URL_FORMATS` should be immutable on user side and display accurate named URL identifier format info.
1. [x] `NAMED_URL_FORMATS` should be exclusive, meaning resources specified in `NAMED_URL_FORMATS` should have named URL, and resources not specified there should *not* have named URL.
1. [x] If a resource can have named URL, its objects should have a `named_url` field which represents the object-specific named URL. That field should only be visible under detail view, not list view.
1. [x] A user following the rules specified in `NAMED_URL_FORMATS` should be able to generate named URL exactly the same as the `named_url` field.
1. [x] A user should be able to access specified resource objects via accurately generated named URL. This includes not only the object itself but also its related URLs, like if `/api/v2/res_name/obj_slug/` is valid, `/api/v2/res_name/obj_slug/related_res_name/` should also be valid.
1. [x] A user should not be able to access specified resource objects if the given named URL is inaccurate. For example, reserved characters not correctly escaped, or components whose corresponding foreign key field pointing nowhere is not replaced by empty string.
1. [ ] A user should be able to dynamically generate named URLs by utilizing `NAMED_URL_GRAPH_NODES`.
