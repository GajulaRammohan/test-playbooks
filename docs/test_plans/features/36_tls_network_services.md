# Implement TLS communication and customization between services

## Owner

  * Yanis Guenane (@Spredzy)

## Summary

As a customer I would like to be able to enable TLS communication between my network services.

  * Nginx: as an administrator I should be able to specify my own certs at install time (via `./setup.sh`)
  * PostgreSQL: as an administrator I should be able to specify my own certs at install time (via `./setup.sh`) and choose to enable/disable SSL
  * RabbitMQ: as an administor I should be able to enable TLS at install time for inter node communication. (Certificates will be generated by the installer itself)
