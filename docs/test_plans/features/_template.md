## Verification Criteria

Provide all the verification items that you will be doing to ensure the feature
is verified and ready to go. As a suggestion create check list like below:

- [ ] Check if some field is added to the API response
- [ ] Another check or verification item

If the feature you are working on is a big feature, or you want to organize the
verification criteria items you can use sub-sections. The example below shows
the verification items separated into endpoints, but you can organize it the
way it makes more sense for your feature:

### API Verification Criteria

### UI Verification Criteria

- [ ] Check if some field is added to the API response
