## Overview

When RHEL approaches the end of a release, it will cut an alpha and beta image. When each image is available, an e-mail is sent out to other Red Hat product groups, prompting the groups to pull the RHEL image, install their product on the platform, and confirm their product remains functional on the new platform. In general, interoperability testing with the alpha image is optional, while testing against the beta image is mandatory.

## Event Driven Approach

While initially this verification was done upon the email reception, an event driven mechanism has been put in place now to handle it automatically.

It is based on the Layered Product Testing Interop team emitting an UMB event that we listen to and run our pipeline upon. Once run, the pipeline will send the result automatically to the LP Testing Interop Team. Below in more details the sequences of events that happen.

1. LP Testing Interop Team emits an UMB event on topic `VirtualTopic.qe.ci.product-scenario.build.complete` that looks like [this](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/PIT/interop-messages/blob/master/examples/product-scenario.build.complete.json)
2. The [LP Teting Listener Job](http://jenkins.ansible.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/view/Tower/job/layered-product-testing-listener/) listens for that event and automatically trigger the [lp-validtory,groovy pipeline](https://github.com/ansible/tower-qa/blob/devel/tools/jenkins/pipelines/lp-validator.groovy)
4. The actual [Layered Product Testing pipeline](http://jenkins.ansible.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/view/Tower/job/Pipelines/job/lptesting-pipeline/) with the proper parameters is finally triggered. A message is sent to Slack `#umb-events` channel with all the related informations
5. Upon job completion a message is sent to UMB to the topic `VirtualTopic.qe.ci.product-scenario.test.complete` that looks like [this](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/PIT/interop-messages/blob/master/examples/product-scenario.test.complete.json). A message is sent to Slack `#umb-events` to let user know the status of the pipeline result.


For now, the Ansible Tower QE team still has to update the JIRA ticket to mark the status as PASS, this will change eventually and this documentation will be updated accordingly.

## Prerequisites

* The Compose ID of the RHEL version to test. It is made available to you on the JIRA ticket linked in the email sent out prompting for testing.


## Versions of Tower to test

* The RHEL pre-release image should be tested with each [currently supported version of Tower](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/ansible-tower).


## Automated Process

The [Layered Product Testing](http://jenkins.ansible.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/view/Tower/job/Pipelines/job/lptesting-main-pipeline/) pipeline will do everything required to perform the proper operation. Simply trigger it and if the pipeline is succesful reports PASS to the Jira ticket.

In a nutshell the pipeline does the following step:

  1. Prepare the environment
  2. Spawn a VM on our [OpenStack](https://rhos-d.infra.prod.upshift.rdu2.redhat.com/dashboard/auth/login/) tenant with the desired Compose ID
  3. Install Ansible Tower on it with the specified version
  4. Run a subset of test to ensure proper operation are functional

Those 4 steps are run for all the [currently supported version of Tower](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/ansible-tower).
