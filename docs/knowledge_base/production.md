### How to Access Production Environments

The Tower QE team currently spins up production instances in the following configurations:
* Non-clustered, single instances on EC2 virtual machines, with a database on the same instance as the Tower server.
  * Comes in multiple linux distributions (RHEL, Ubuntu) and with different versions of Ansible.
* In a clustered environment on multiple EC2 virtual machines, with multiple traditional instances and isolated instances. With this configuration, postgres lives on its own VM.
* In a clustered environment in OpenShift, with multiple Tower pods. Our database here is in a separate ephemeral postgres pod.

If you want to access to these nightlies, visit the following locations in Jenkins. You will need to be on the VPN to access Jenkins.
* [For single instance production environment](http://jenkins.ansible.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/view/Tower/job/Test_Tower_Install/)
* [For multiple instance clustered environment](http://jenkins.ansible.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/view/Tower/job/Test_Tower_Install_Cluster/)
* [For multiple instance OpenShift environment](https://ansible-tower-web-svc-tower-qe.openshift.ansible.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/)
  * You need to be on the VPN to access our Tower OpenShift environment.
  
If you access a production instance, sometimes things will be happening on their own. This is because:
* Our automated tests are running on that instance (you may want to grab another instance).
* Another Tower team member is using this instance (this is especially bad with our OpenShift environment).
  * Try to coordinate as much as possible to avoid a chance of collision if you are using either of our clustered environments.
  
For our production instances in EC2, we generate Ansible inventory files that contain a Tower web address and a username that you will need to ssh into that instance.
* This is a Jenkins artifact produced by our Jenkins jobs.
* For our single-VM setups, it is called `inventory.log`.
* For our multiple-VM setups, it is called `inventory.cluster`.

These look like this:

* This file is generated by the jinja2 templating engine. Really what's important is the contents of `ansible_host` (your Tower web address) and `ansible_user` (ssh user).

After you access Tower via its web address, you will need to:
* Accept Tower's security certificate.
* Authenticate to Tower using the Tower login screen (ask a QE team member for credentials).
* Supply a valid Tower license. Either generate one yourself [here](https://github.com/ansible/tower-license) or ask a team member for a license.

Our Jenkins scripts add ssh public keys onto spawned EC2 instances. The list of added public keys is [here](https://github.com/ansible/tower-qa/blob/master/playbooks/roles/auth_keys/defaults/main.yml#L2). If you want to be included on this list, ask a QE team member.

Lastly, if you want to spin up your own Tower instance, the setup tarballs are here:
* For official releases, see [here](https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/).
* For development releases, see [here](http://nightlies.testing.ansible.com/ansible-tower_nightlies_m8u16fz56qr6q7/).
