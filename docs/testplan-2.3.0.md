# Tower 2.3.0 Release Test Plan

## Resources
* 1 full-time quality engineer - cwang
* 1 part-time quality engineer - jlaska

## Assumptions
1. UI testing is performed manually.  While basic automated coverage exists, it is insufficient to test customer workflows.

## Features Not Tested
1. Comprehensive RBAC coverage is covered in API unit and integration tests, but not explicitly in the UI testing.
