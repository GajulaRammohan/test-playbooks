## Retrospective

This section is intended to gather feedback on things that worked well and
things that could have been better during the release cycle. The feedback will
be used as a basis for identifying areas for improvement for future releases.
Any thoughts, big or small, are valuable.

### Feedback/issues/concerns

* QA UI automation exists, but isn't run on a regular automatic basis through jenkins.  Several UI changes to improve UI test-ability introduced regressions elsewhere in the UI.  These would have been caught with existing UI automation.
* We didn't specify the HA tower-manage interfaces in a detailed fashion in the spec (or update it), and eng didn't publish a "this is what we're doing" guide, so we end up reverse-engineering what got done, and QA isn't sure what to test, or what is supported.

### Recommendations

1. Selenium UI automation needs to be fully automated by jenkins
