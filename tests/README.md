1. Why does adding a user to an org return no data '' and status_code=NO_CONTENT?
2. Why does the duplicate inventory json have *both* fields ['__all__', 'name']?
3. Why '/api/v1/inventory' and not '/api/v1/inventories'?
4. Why does '/api/v1/hosts' POST accept fields 'last_job' and 'last_job_host_summary'
